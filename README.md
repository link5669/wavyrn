• In the white menu bar, the red underlining of the menu options is not working as intended (see reference: https://www.ictus-audio.com/portfolio-masonry/)yay

• The line of profiles should be center aligned with the page. You'll notice that when the window size is decreased, the profiles are not center aligned with the "All, Project Management..." menu bar
• Profile pictures and text should be smaller (for reference, the profile text size should match the "All, Project Management..." menu bar)
• Max Jaime's profile picture does not load properly
• When you hover over the "All, Project Management..." menu options, the cursor should change to a glove. It should also do the effect described in the drafts
• My title and Ananta's title should have a line break after Co-Founder,
• Hovering over the profile pictures should show the zooming in (quickly), instead of being zoomed in immediately
• When opening a profile, the "X" (close) button should have a box around it (see drafts). Also, it should be slightly bigger and right-aligned with the black line above it (see drafts)
• When you click on a profile from the full list of profiles, for a second, you see all the profiles moving down
• Profiles
