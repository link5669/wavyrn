• The letter icon and contact@wavyrn.com email should also be pushed to the right a little bit such that the letter icon is center aligned with the Wavyrn icon underneath it
• In the white menu bar, the red underlining of the menu options is not working as intended (see reference: https://www.ictus-audio.com/portfolio-masonry/)

About Us
• The proportions of the text in the banner at the top of the page do not match the draft.

    — Header should be "WE MAKE AUDIO" in bold text
    — The sub-header text box should be thinner horizontally (text should be 3-4 lines and bolded)

• The number of profiles per line should stay at 5 profiles upon increase the window size. (But I like that it goes down to 4 or 3 when you decrease the window size)
• The line of profiles should be center aligned with the page. You'll notice that when the window size is decreased, the profiles are not center aligned with the "All, Project Management..." menu bar
• Profile pictures and text should be smaller (for reference, the profile text size should match the "All, Project Management..." menu bar)
• Max Jaime's profile picture does not load properly
• When you hover over the "All, Project Management..." menu options, the cursor should change to a glove. It should also do the effect described in the drafts
• My title and Ananta's title should have a line break after Co-Founder,
• Hovering over the profile pictures should show the zooming in (quickly), instead of being zoomed in immediately
• When opening a profile, the "X" (close) button should have a box around it (see drafts). Also, it should be slightly bigger and right-aligned with the black line above it (see drafts)
• When you click on a profile from the full list of profiles, for a second, you see all the profiles moving down
• Profiles

    — It looks like you copy and pasted all the text in the textedit document, but the textedit document also includes instructions for social media and other things. Please add the website and social media links/icons (see drafts)
    — Please also add the media underneath the bios (see drafts)
